efficient  mutual 
agreement procedure.

38. 
In  the  context  of  the  HTVI  approach  it  is  especially  relevant  that 
under Article 25 the mutual agreement procedure “can be set in motion by 
the taxpayer without waiting until the taxation considered by him to be not 
in accordance with the Convention has been charged against or notified to 
him. To be able to set the procedure in motion, he must, and it is sufficient 
if he does, establish that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States 
will  result  in  such  taxation,  and  that  this  taxation  appears  as  a  risk  which 
is not merely possible but probable” (see paragraph 14 of the Commentary 
to  Article  25  of  the  Model  Tax  Convention).  This  possibility  under  the 
applicable tax treaty may alleviate some of the concerns arising in relation to 
timing issues and reduce the instances of unresolved double taxation.

39. 
Finally,  one  of  the  best  practices  recommended  in  the  BEPS  Report 
on Action 14 and that is relevant for HTVI transactions is that, subject to the

requirements of paragraph 1 of Article 25, jurisdictions implement appropriate 
procedures  to  permit,  in  certain  cases  and  after  an  initial  tax  assessment, 
taxpayer requests for the multiyear resolution through the MAP of recurring 
issues with respect to filed tax years, where the relevant facts and circumstances 
are the same and subject to the verification of such facts and circumstances on 
audit.

Annex to Chapter VIII 

Examples to illustrate the guidance on 
cost contribution arrangements

Example 1

1. 
Example 1 illustrates the general principle that contributions should 
be assessed at value (i.e. based on arm’s length prices) in order to produce 
results that are consistent with the arm’s length principle.

2. 
Company  A  and  Company  B  are  members  of  an  MNE  group  and 
decide to enter into a CCA. Company A performs Service 1 and Company B 
performs  Service  2.  Company  A  and  Company  B  each  “consume”  both 
services (that is, Company A receives a benefit from Service 2 performed by 
Company B, and Company B receives a benefit from Service 1 performed 
by Company A).

3. 

Assume that the costs and value of the services are as follows:

Costs of providing Service 1 (cost incurred by Company A)

Value of Service 1 (i.e. the arm’s length price that Company A would charge Company B 
for the provision of Service 1)

Costs of providing Service 2 (cost incurred by Company B)

Value of Service 2 (i.e. the arm’s length price that Company B would charge Company A 
for the provision of Service 2)

100 per unit

120 per unit

100 per unit

105 per unit

4. 
In year 1 and in subsequent years, Company A provides 30 units of 
Service 1 to the group and Company B provides 20 units of Service 2 to the 
group. Under the CCA, the calculation of costs and benefits are as follows:

Cost to Company A of providing services (30 units × 100 per unit)

3 000

(60% of total costs)

Cost to Company B of providing services (20 units × 100 per unit)

2 000

(40% of total costs)

Total cost to group

5 000

Company A and Company B each consume 15 units of Service 1 and 10 units of Service 2:

Service 1: 15 units × 120 per unit

Service 2: 10 units × 105 per unit

(50% of total value of 5 700)

5. 
Under  the  CCA,  the  value  of  Company  A  and  Company  B’s 
contributions should each correspond to their respective proportionate shares 
of expected benefits, i.e. 50%. Since the total value of contributions under 
the CCA is 5 700, this means each party must contribute 2 850. The value 
of Company A’s in-kind contribution is 3 600 and the value of Company B’s 
in-kind  contribution  is  2  100.  Accordingly,  Company  B  should  make  a 
balancing payment to Company A of 750. This has the effect of “topping up” 
Company B’s contribution to 2 850; and offsets Company A’s contribution to 
the same amount.

6. 
If  contributions  were  measured  at  cost  instead  of  at  value,  since 
Companies  A  and  B  each  receive  50%  of  the  total  benefits,  they  would 
have  been  required  contribute  50%  of  the  total  costs,  or  2  500  each,
