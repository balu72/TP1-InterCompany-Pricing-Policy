16. 
Under  the  CCA,  the  value  of  Company  A  and  Company  B’s 
contributions should each correspond to their respective proportionate shares 
of  expected  benefits  i.e.  50%.  Since  the  total  value  of  contributions  under 
the  CCA  is  6  000,  this  means  each  party  must  contribute  3  000.  The  value 
of  Company  A’s  in-kind  contribution  is  3  600.  The  value  of  Company  B’s 
in-kind  contribution  is  2  400.  Accordingly,  Company  B  should  make  a 
balancing payment to Company A of 600. This has the effect of “topping up” 
Company B’s contribution to 3 000; and offsets Company A’s contribution to 
the same amount. Example 3 illustrates that, in general, assessing contributions 
at cost will not result in an arm’s length outcome even in those situations in 
which the arm’s length mark-up on the cost of contributions is identical.

Example 4

Company  A  and  Company  B  are  members  of  an  MNE  group  and 
17. 
decide  to  undertake  the  development  of  an  intangible  through  a  CCA.  The 
intangible is anticipated to be highly profitable based on Company B’s existing 
intangibles,  its  track  record  and  its  experienced  research  and  development 
staff.  Company  A  performs,  through  its  own  personnel,  all  the  functions 
expected  of  a  participant  in  a  development  CCA  obtaining  an  independent 
right  to  exploit  the  resulting  intangible,  including  functions  required  to 
exercise control over the risks it contractually assumes in accordance with the 
principles outlined in paragraphs 8.14 to 8.18. The particular intangible in this 
example is expected to take five years to develop before possible commercial 
exploitation and if successful, is anticipated to have value for ten years after 
initial exploitation.

18. 
Under the CCA, Company A will contribute to funding associated 
with the development of the intangible (its share of the development costs are 
anticipated to be USD 100 million per year for five years). Company B will 
contribute  the  development  rights  associated  with  its  existing  intangibles,

to  which  Company  A  is  granted  rights  under  the  CCA  irrespective  of  the 
outcome of the CCA’s objectives, and will perform all activities related to the 
development, maintenance, and exploitation of the intangible. The value of 
Company B’s contributions (encompassing the performance of activities as 
well as the use of the pre-existing intangibles) would need to be determined 
in accordance with the guidance in Chapter VI and would likely be based 
on the anticipated value of the intangible expected to be produced under the 
CCA, less the value of the funding contribution by Company A.

19. 
Once  developed,  the  intangible  is  anticipated  to  result  in  global 
profits of USD 550 million per year (years 6 to 15). The CCA provides that 
Company  B  will  have  exclusive  rights  to  exploit  the  resulting  intangible 
in  Country  B  (anticipated  to  result  in  profits  of  USD  220  million  per  year 
in  years  6  to  15)  and  Company  A  will  have  exclusive  rights  to  exploit 
the  intangible  in  the  rest  of  the  world  (anticipated  to  result  in  profits  of 
USD 330 million per year).

20. 
Taking  into  account  the  realistic  alternatives  of  Company  A  and 
Company  B  it  is  determined  that  the  value  of  Company  A’s  contribution 
is  equivalent  to  a  risk-adjusted  return  on  its  R&D  funding  commitment. 
Assume that this is determined to be USD 110 million per year (for years 6 
to 15).1 However, under the CCA Company A is anticipated to reap benefits 
amounting  to  USD  330  million  of  profits  per  year  in  years  6  to  15  (rather 
than  USD  110  million).  This  additional  anticipated  value  in  the  rights 
Company A obtains (tha
