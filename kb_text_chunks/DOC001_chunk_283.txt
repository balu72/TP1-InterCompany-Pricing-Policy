nces in levels of working capital. 
The following example adjusts the comparable’s result to reflect 
the tested party’s levels of working capital. Alternative calculations 
are to adjust the tested party’s results to reflect the comparables 
levels of working capital or to adjust both the tested party and the 
comparable’s results to reflect “zero” working capital.

A practical example of calculating working capital adjustments:

The following calculation is hypothetical. It is only to demonstrate

•  An issue in making working capital adjustments is what point in time 
are the Receivables, Inventory and Payables compared between the 
tested party and the comparables. The above example compares their 
levels on the last day of the financial year. This may not, however, 
be appropriate if this timing does not give a representative level of 
working capital over the year. In such cases, averages might be used 
if they better reflect the level of working capital over the year.

•  A  major  issue  in  making  working  capital  adjustments  involves  the 
selection of the appropriate interest rate (or rates) to use. The rate (or 
rates) should generally be determined by reference to the rate(s) of 
interest applicable to a commercial enterprise operating in the same 
market as the tested party. In most cases a commercial loan rate will 
be  appropriate.  In  cases  where  the  tested  party’s  working  capital 
balance  is  negative  (that  is  Payables  >  Receivables  +  Inventory),  a 
different rate may be appropriate. The rate used in the above example 
reflects the rate at which TestCo is able to borrow funds in its local 
market.  This  example  also  assumes  that  the  same  interest  rate  is 
appropriate for payables, receivables and inventory, but that may or 
may not be the case in practice. Where different rates of interest are 
found to be appropriately applicable to individual classes of assets or 
liabilities,  the  calculation  may  be  considerably  more  complex  than 
shown above.

•  The  purpose  of  working  capital  adjustments  is  to  improve  the 
reliability of the comparables. There is a question whether working 
capital  adjustments  should  be  made  when  the  results  of  some 
comparables can be reliably adjusted while the results of some others 
cannot.

Annex I to Chapter IV 

Sample Memoranda of Understanding 
for Competent Authorities to establish 
bilateral safe harbours

Introduction

This  Annex  contains  sample  Memoranda  of  Understanding  (MOUs) 
for use by Competent Authorities in negotiating bilateral safe harbours for 
common categories of transfer pricing cases involving low risk distribution 
functions,  low  risk  manufacturing  functions,  and  low  risk  research  and 
development  functions.  It  is  intended  to  provide  jurisdictions  with  a  tool 
to  adapt  and  use  in  addressing,  through  bilateral  safe  harbours,  important 
classes  of  t
