 transfer pricing method with 
regard  to  the  category  of  transaction  and  the  reasons  for  selecting 
that method.

•  An  indication  of  which  associated  enterprise  is  selected  as  the 
tested party, if applicable, and an explanation of the reasons for this 
selection.

•  A  summary  of  the  important  assumptions  made  in  applying  the 

transfer pricing methodology.

• 

If relevant, an explanation of the reasons for performing a multi-year 
analysis.

•  A  list  and  description  of  selected  comparable  uncontrolled  trans-
actions  (internal  or  external),  if  any,  and  information  on  relevant 
financial  indicators  for  independent  enterprises  relied  on  in  the 
transfer pricing analysis, including a description of the comparable 
search methodology and the source of such information.

•  A description of any comparability adjustments performed, and an 
indication of whether adjustments have been made to the results of 
the tested party, the comparable uncontrolled transactions, or both.

•  A description of the reasons for concluding that relevant transactions 
were priced on an arm’s length basis based on the application of the 
selected transfer pricing method.

•  A  summary  of  financial  information  used  in  applying  the  transfer 

pricing methodology.

•  A  copy  of  existing  unilateral  and  bilateral/multilateral  APAs  and 
other tax rulings to which the local tax jurisdiction is not a party and 
which are related to controlled transactions described above.

1.

cross-reference to the master file is sufficient.
