t is, the anticipated value above and beyond the value 
of Company A’s funding investment) reflects the contribution of Company B’s 
pre-existing contributions of intangibles and R&D commitment to the CCA. 
Company A needs to pay for this additional value it receives. Accordingly, 
balancing  payments  from  Company  A  to  Company  B  to  account  for  the 
difference are required. In effect, Company A would need to make a balancing 
payment associated with those contributions to Company B equal in present 
value,  taking  into  account  the  risk  associated  with  this  future  income,  to 
USD 220 million per year anticipated in years 6 to 15.

1. 

For  purposes  of  this  example,  it  is  not  necessary  to  derive  these  results.  The 
example assumes that making a funding “investment” of USD 100 million per 
year for five years in a project with this level of risk should earn at arm’s length 
anticipated profits of USD 110 million per year for the following ten years. The 
results used herein are included for the purposes of demonstrating the principles 
illustrated in this example only and no guidance as to the level of arm’s length 
returns to participants in CCAs should be inferred.

ANNEX TO CHAPTER VIII: EXAMPLES ON COST CONTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS – 651

Example 5

The  facts  are  the  same  as  in  Example  4  except  that  the  functional 
21. 
analysis indicates Company A has no capacity to make decisions to take on 
or  decline  the  risk-bearing  opportunity  represented  by  its  participation  in 
the CCA, or to make decisions on whether and how to respond to the risks 
associated with the opportunity. It also has no capability to mitigate the risks 
or to assess and make decisions relating to the risk mitigation activities of 
another party conducted on its behalf.

22. 
In  accurately  delineating  the  transactions  associated  with  the  CCA, 
the  functional  analysis  therefore  indicates  that  Company  A  does  not  control 
its  specific  risks  under  the  CCA  in  accordance  with  the  guidance  in 
paragraph 8.15 and consequently is not entitled to a share in the output that is 
the objective of the CCA.
