ntractual 
terms  between  associated  enterprises  that  separate  ownership,  the 
assumption of risk, and/or funding of investments in intangibles from 
performance of important functions, control over risk, and decisions 
related to investment in ways that are not observed in transactions 
between  independent  enterprises  and  that  may  contribute  to  base 
erosion and profit shifting.

Notwithstanding 

these  potential  challenges,  applying 

the  arm’s 
length  principle  and  the  provisions  of  Chapters  I-III  within  an  established 
framework can, in most cases, yield an appropriate allocation of the returns 
derived by the MNE group from the exploitation of intangibles.
6.34.  The  framework  for  analysing  transactions  involving  intangibles 
between associated enterprises requires taking the following steps, consistent 
with  the  guidance  for  identifying  the  commercial  or  financial  relations 
provided in Section D.1 of Chapter I:

i) 

Identify  the  intangibles  used  or  transferred  in  the  transaction  with 
specificity and the specific, economically significant risks associated 
with  the  development,  enhancement,  maintenance,  protection,  and 
exploitation of the intangibles;

ii)  Identify  the  full  contractual  arrangements,  with  special  emphasis  on 
determining  legal  ownership  of  intangibles  based  on  the  terms  and 
conditions of legal arrangements, including relevant registrations, licence 
agreements, other relevant contracts, and other indicia of legal ownership, 
and  the  contractual  rights  and  obligations,  including  contractual 
assumption of risks in the relations between the associated enterprises;

iii)  Identify  the  parties  performing  functions  (including  specifically 
the important functions described in paragraph 6.56), using assets, 
and managing risks related to developing, enhancing, maintaining, 
protecting, and exploiting the intangibles by means of the functional 
analysis,  and  in  particular  which  parties  control  any  outsourced 
functions, and control specific, economically significant risks;

iv)  Confirm the consistency between the terms of the relevant contractual 
arrangements and the conduct of the parties, and determine whether 
the  party  assuming  economically  significant  risks  under  step  4  (i) 
of  paragraph  1.60,  controls  the  risks  and  has  the  financial  capacity 
to  assume  the  risks  relating  to  the  development,  enhancement, 
maintenance, protection, and exploitation of the intangibles;

v)  Delineate the actual controlled transactions related to the development, 
enhancement, maintenance, protection, and exploitation of intangibles 
in light of the legal ownership of the intangibles, the other relevant 
contractual relations under relevant registrations and contracts, and 
the conduct of the parties, including their relevant contributions of 
functions,  assets  and  risks,  taking  into  account  the  framework  for 
analysing and allocating risk under Section D.1.2.1 of Chapter I;

vi)  Where possible, determine arm’s length prices for these transactions 
consistent  with  each  party’s  contributions  of  functions  performed, 
assets used, and risks assumed, unless the guidance in Section D.2 
of Chapter I applies.

B.1.  Intangible ownership and contractual terms relating to 

intangibles

6.35.  Legal rights and contractual arrangements form the starting point for 
any transfer pricing analysis of transactions involving intangibles. The terms of 
a transaction may be found in written contracts, public records such as patent 
or trademark registrations, or in correspondence and/or other communications 
among  the  parties.  Contracts  may  describe  the  roles,  responsibilities  and 
rights of associated enterprises with respect to intangibles. They may describe 
which entity or entities provide funding, undertake research and development, 
maintain and protect intangibles, and perform functions necessary to exploit 
the intangibles, such as manufacturing, marketing and distribution. They may 
describe how receipts and expenses of the MNE associated with intangibles 
are to be allocated and may specify the form and amount of payment to all 
members of the group for their contributions. The prices and other conditions 
contained in such contracts may or may not be consistent with the arm’s length 
principle.

6.36.  Where no written terms exist, or where the facts of the case, including 
the  conduct  of  the  parties,  differ  from  the  written  terms  of  any  agreement 
between them or supplement these written terms, the actual transaction must 
be deduced from the facts as established, including the conduct of the parties 
(see  Section  D.1.1  of  Chapter  I).  It  is,  therefore,  good  practice  for  associated
