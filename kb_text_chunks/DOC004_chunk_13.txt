of  the 
information contained in Table 1 may relate to a period that does not correspond with the fiscal year of the 
Reporting MNE.

Example 1 

A Co, the UPE of MNE A, is resident in Country A and prepares its annual consolidated financial statements with a 
fiscal year end of 31 December. MNE A includes two other Constituent Entities: B Co which is resident in Country B 
and prepares entity financial statements with a fiscal year end of 30 June; and C Co which is resident in Country C 
and prepares entity financial statements with a fiscal year end of 31 December. A Co has chosen to include in its CbC 
report information for the fiscal years of Constituent Entities ending within the 12 month period preceding its own fiscal 
year end.  

When A Co prepares its CbC report for the reporting fiscal year ending 31 December 20Y1, Table 1 will include: 
For Country A, information on A Co for the 12 month fiscal year from 1 January 20Y1 to 31 December 20Y1. 
For Country B, information on B Co for the 12 month fiscal year from 1 July 20Y0 to 30 June 20Y1. 
For Country C, information on C Co for the 12 month fiscal year from 1 January 20Y1 to 31 December 20Y1.

Where  the reporting fiscal  year of the  Reporting MNE is of a period other than 12 months, the general 
instructions at page 32 of the BEPS Action 13 report should be applied such that, at the discretion of the 
Reporting MNE, the template should reflect on a consistent basis either (i) information for the fiscal year 
of the relevant Constituent Entities ending on the same date as the fiscal year of the Reporting MNE, or 
ending within the fiscal year of the Reporting MNE, or (ii) information for all the relevant Constituent Entities 
reported for the fiscal year of the Reporting MNE. As described above, where the Reporting MNE chooses 
to apply approach (i) some of the information contained in Table 1 may relate to a period that does not 
correspond with the fiscal year of the Reporting MNE 1. However, because the length of the reporting fiscal 
year of the Reporting MNE may differ from the length of the fiscal year of Constituent Entities, the impact 
of this may be greater than that in Example 1. 

• 

• 

Information may be included in Table 1 for a 12 month fiscal year of a particular Constituent Entity 
ending in the fiscal year of the Reporting MNE. 

Information  may  be  included  in  Table  1  for  more  than  one  12  month  fiscal  year  of  a  particular 
Constituent Entity ending in the fiscal year of the Reporting MNE (e.g. in cases where the fiscal 
year of the Reporting MNE is for a period in excess of 12 months). 

•  There  may  be  no  information  to  include  in  Table  1  for  a  particular  Constituent  Entity,  if  the 
Constituent Entity does not have a fiscal year ending in the fiscal year of the Reporting MNE (e.g. 
in cases where the fiscal year of the Reporting MNE is for a period of less than 12 months). If this 
is the case for all Constituent Entities in a particular tax jurisdiction, the tax jurisdiction should be 
listed in Table 1 and the remainder of the row completed with zeros.  

In each case, all Constituent Entities should be included in Table 2 as normal, even if there is no information 
to report in Table 1.

Example 2.a. 

A Co, the UPE of MNE A, is resident in Country A and prepares its consolidated financial statements for the 12 month 
period ending 31 December 20Y1. A Co then changes its fiscal year end and prepares its next set of consolidated 
financial statements for the six month period ending 30 June 20Y2. Going forward, A Co prepares annual consolidated 
financial statements for each fiscal year ending 30 June.  

MNE A includes two other Constituent Entities: B Co which is resident in Country B and prepares entity financial 
statements with a fiscal year end of 30 June; and C Co which is resident in Country C and prepares entity financial 
statements with a fiscal year end of 31 December. A Co has chosen to include in its CbC report information for the 
fiscal year of Constituent Entities ending within its own fiscal year.  

A Co’s CbC report for the 12 month reporting fiscal year ending 31 December 20Y1 includes the following information 
in Table 1: 

For Country A, information on A Co for the 12 month fiscal year from 1 January 20Y1 to 31 December 20Y1. 
For Country B, information on B Co for the 12 month fiscal year from 1 July 20Y0 to 30 June 20Y1. 
For Country C, information on C Co for the 12 month fiscal year from 1 January 20Y1 to 31 December 20Y1.
