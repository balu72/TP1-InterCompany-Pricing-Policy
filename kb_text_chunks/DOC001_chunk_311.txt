ANNEX III TO CHAPTER V: B. TEMPLATE FOR THE COUNTRy-By-COUNTRy REPORT – GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS – 553

B. Template for the Country-by-Country Report – General instructions

Purpose

This Annex III to Chapter V of these Guidelines contains a template for 
reporting  a  multinational  enterprise’s  (MNE)  group  allocation  of  income, 
taxes and business activities on a tax jurisdiction-by-tax jurisdiction basis. 
These  instructions  form  an  integral  part  of  the  model  template  for  the 
Country-by-Country Report.

Definitions

Reporting MNE

A Reporting MNE is the ultimate parent entity of an MNE group.

Constituent Entity

For purposes of completing Annex III, a Constituent Entity of the MNE 
group is (i) any separate business unit of an MNE group that is included in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements of the MNE group for financial reporting 
purposes, or would be so included if equity interests in such business unit of 
the  MNE  group  were  traded  on  a  public  securities  exchange;  (ii)  any  such 
business unit that is excluded from the MNE group’s Consolidated Financial 
Statements  solely  on  size  or  materiality  grounds;  and  (iii)  any  permanent 
establishment  of  any  separate  business  unit  of  the  MNE  group  included 
in  (i)  or  (ii)  above  provided  the  business  unit  prepares  a  separate  financial 
statement for such permanent establishment for financial reporting, regulatory, 
tax reporting, or internal management control purposes.

Treatment of Branches and Permanent Establishments

The  permanent  establishment  data  should  be  reported  by  reference 
to  the  tax  jurisdiction  in  which  it  is  situated  and  not  by  reference  to  the 
tax  jurisdiction  of  residence  of  the  business  unit  of  which  the  permanent 
establishment is a part. Residence tax jurisdiction reporting for the business 
unit of which the permanent establishment is a part should exclude financial 
data related to the permanent establishment.

554 – ANNEX III TO CHAPTER V: B. TEMPLATE FOR THE COUNTRy-By-COUNTRy REPORT – GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

Consolidated Financial Statements

The Consolidated Financial Statements are the financial statements of an 
MNE group in which the assets, liabilities, income, expenses and cash flows 
of  the  ultimate  parent  entity  and  the  Constituent  Entities  are  presented  as 
those of a single economic entity.

Period covered by the annual template

The  template  should  cover  the  fiscal  year  of  the  Reporting  MNE.  For 
Constituent Entities, at the discretion of the Reporting MNE, the template 
should reflect on a consistent basis either (i) information for the fiscal year 
of the relevant Constituent Entities ending on the same date as the fiscal year 
of the Reporting MNE, or ending within the 12 month period preceding such 
date, or (ii) information for all the relevant Constituent Entities reported for 
the fiscal year of the Reporting MNE.

Source of data

The  Reporting  MNE  should  consistently  use  the  same  sources  of  data 
from  year  to  year  in  completing  the  template.  The  Reporting  MNE  may 
choose to use data from its consolidation reporting packages, from separate 
entity  statutory  financial  statements,  regulatory  financial  statements,  or 
internal management accounts. It is not necessary to reconcile the revenue, 
profit  and  tax  reporting  in  the  template  to  the  consolidated  financial 
statements.  If  statutory  financial  statements  are  used  as  the  basis  for 
reporting, all amounts should be translated to the stated functional currency 
of  the  Reporting  MNE  at  the  average  exchange  rate  for  the  year  stated  in 
the  Additional  Information  section  of  the  template.  Adjustments  need  not 
be made, however, for differences in accounting principles applied from tax 
jurisdiction to tax jurisdiction.

The  Reporting  MNE  should  prov
