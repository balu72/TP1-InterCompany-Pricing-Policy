whereas,  Chapter  III  of  the  Convention  authorises  the  exchange  of  information  for

the competent authorities of the Jurisdictions to agree on the scope and modalities of such 
automatic exchanges;

whereas, Article 6 of the Convention provides that two or more Parties can mutually 
agree  to  exchange  information  automatically,  albeit  that  the  actual  exchange  of  the

undesirable economic outcomes, including for individual businesses, in accordance with 
paragraph 2 of Article 24 of the Convention, as well as paragraph 1 of Section 6 of this 
Agreement;

whereas,  mutual  agreement  procedures,  for  instance  on  the  basis  of  a  double  tax 
convention  concluded  between  the  jurisdictions  of  the  Competent  Authorities,  remain 
applicable  in  cases  where  the  CbC  Report  has  been  exchanged  on  the  basis  of  this
