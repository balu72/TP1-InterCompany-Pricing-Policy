As shown in the above example, excluding some specific items from 
the determination of the relevant profits to be split implies that each party 
remains responsible for its own expenses in relation to it. As a consequence, 
the decision whether or not to exclude some specific items must be consistent 
with the accurate delineation of the transaction.

484 – ANNEX II TO CHAPTER II: EXAMPLES ON THE PROFIT SPLIT METHOD

Scenario 2

As another example, in some cases it may be appropriate to back out 
76. 
a  category  of  expenses  to  the  extent  that  the  profit  splitting  factor(s)  used 
in  the  residual  profit  split  analysis  relies  on  those  expenses.  For  example, 
in  cases  where  relative  expenditure  contributing  to  the  development  of  a 
unique and valuable intangible is determined to be the most appropriate profit 
splitting factor, residual profits can be based on operating profits before that 
expenditure. After determining the split of residual profits, each associated 
enterprise  then  subtracts  its  own  expenditure.  This  can  be  illustrated  as 
follows. Assume the facts are the same as in Scenario 1 to this example in 
paragraph 74 above and assume the overhead expenses are not excluded from 
the determination of the residual profit to be split.

Step one: determining the basic return for the manufacturing activities 
(Cost of Goods Sold + 10% in this example)

Same as in Scenario 1, Step 1 above.

Step two: determining the residual profit to be split

a) If it is determined as the operating profit after expenditure in 
relation to the unique and valuable intangible:

Same as in Scenario 1, Step 2, case a.

b) If it is determined as the operating profit before expenditure in 
relation to the unique and valuable intangible:

i.e. A and B are allocated the same profits as in the case where the relevant 
profit  to  be  split  is  determined  as  the  operating  profit  after  expenditure  in 
relation to the unique and valuable intangible, see case a) above.

This example illustrates the fact that, when the profit splitting factor 
77. 
used  to  split  the  residual  profit  relies  on  a  category  of  expenses  incurred 
during  the  period,  it  is  irrelevant  whether  the  residual  profit  to  be  split  is 
determined before the expenses are deducted by each party, or whether the 
residual profit to be split is determined after the expenses are deducted. The 
outcome  can  however  be  different  in  the  case  where  the  splitting  factor  is 
based on the accumulated expenditure of the prior as well as current years.
