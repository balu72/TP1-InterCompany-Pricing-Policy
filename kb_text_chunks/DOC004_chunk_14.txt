Where a Reporting MNE chooses to include information for the fiscal year of Constituent Entities ending 
on the same date as the fiscal year of the Reporting MNE, or ending within the fiscal year of the Reporting 
MNE, it should include in Table 3 the following explanations, if applicable. 

• 

• 

If Table 1 includes information that relates to the fiscal year(s) of one or more Constituent Entities 
that cover a period that  is  longer or shorter than the  fiscal year of the Reporting MNE, Table 3 
should include one or more statements that “Table 1 includes information on [name of Constituent 
Entity/Entities and residence jurisdictions] for the fiscal year [start date to end date of relevant fiscal 
year]”.  

If Table 1 does not include information on one or more Constituent Entities that do not have a fiscal 
year  ending  in  the  fiscal  year  of  the  Reporting  MNE,  Table  3  should  include  a  statement  that 
“Table 1 does not contain information on the following Constituent [Entity/Entities], which do not 
have  a  fiscal  year  ending  in  the  reporting  fiscal  year:  [list  of  names  of  Constituent  Entities  and 
residence jurisdictions]”.

Example 3.a. 

A Co, the UPE of MNE A, is resident in Country A and prepares its consolidated financial statements for the 12 month 
period ending 31 December 20Y1. A Co then changes its fiscal year end and prepares its next set of consolidated 
financial statements for the 18 month period ending 30 June 20Y3. Going forward, A Co prepares annual consolidated 
financial statements for each fiscal year ending 30 June.  

MNE A includes two other Constituent Entities: B Co which is resident in Country B and prepares entity financial 
statements with a fiscal year end of 30 June; and C Co which is resident in Country C and prepares entity financial 
statements with a fiscal year end of 31 December. A Co has chosen to include in its CbC report information for the 
fiscal year of Constituent Entities ending within its own fiscal year.  

A Co’s CbC report for the 12 month reporting fiscal year ending 31 December 20Y1 includes the following information 
in Table 1: 

For Country A, information on A Co for the 12 month fiscal year from 1 January 20Y1 to 31 December 20Y1.
