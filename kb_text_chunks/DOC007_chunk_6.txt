 10 lakh is seen. 

Interpretation:  These  facts  suggest  that  the  effective  management  of  the  A  Co.  may 
have  been  usurped  by  the  parent  company  B  Co.    Therefore, POEM  of  A  Co. may  in 
such cases be not presumed to be outside India even though A Co. is engaged in active 
business outside India and majority of board meeting are held outside India.  

Example 5: An Indian multinational group has a local holding company A Co. in country 
X.    The A  Co.  also has  100% downstream  subsidiaries  B  Co.  and C Co.  in  country  X 
and  D  Co.  in  country  Y.    The  A  Co.  has  income  only  by  way  of  dividend  and  interest 
from investments made in its subsidiaries.  The Place of Effective Management of A Co. 
is in India and is exercised by ultimate parent company of the group.  The subsidiaries 
B,  C  and  D  are  engaged  in  active  business  outside  India.    The  meetings  of  Board  of 
Director of B Co., C Co. and D Co. are held in country X and Y respectively.
