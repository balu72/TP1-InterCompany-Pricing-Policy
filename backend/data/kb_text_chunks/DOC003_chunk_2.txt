BEPS  project.  Developing 
countries have been engaged extensively via a number of different mechanisms, including 
direct participation in the Committee on Fiscal Affairs. In addition, regional tax organisations 
such as the African Tax Administration Forum, the Centre de rencontre des administrations 
fiscales and the Centro Interamericano de Administraciones Tributarias, joined international 
organisations  such  as  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  the  world  Bank  and  the  United 
Nations, in contributing to the work. Stakeholders have been consulted at length: in total, 
the BEPS project received more than 1 400 submissions from industry, advisers, NGOs and 
academics. Fourteen public consultations were held, streamed live on line, as were webcasts 
where the OECD Secretariat periodically updated the public and answered questions.

After  two  years  of  work,  the  15  actions  have  now  been  completed.  All  the  different 
outputs, including those delivered in an interim form in 2014, have been consolidated into 
a comprehensive package. The BEPS package of measures represents the first substantial 
renovation of the international tax rules in almost a century. Once the new measures become 
applicable,  it  is  expected  that  profits  will  be  reported  where  the  economic  activities  that 
generate them are carried out and where value is created. BEPS planning strategies that rely 
on outdated rules or on poorly co-ordinated domestic measures will be rendered ineffective.

Implementation therefore becomes key at this stage. The BEPS package is designed 
to be implemented via changes in domestic law and practices, and via treaty provisions, 
with negotiations for a multilateral instrument under way and expected to be finalised in 
2016. OECD and G20 countries have also agreed to continue to work together to ensure a 
consistent and co-ordinated implementation of the BEPS recommendations. Globalisation 
requires  that  global  solutions  and  a  global  dialogue  be  established  which  go  beyond 
OECD and G20 countries. To further this objective, in 2016 OECD and G20 countries will 
conceive an inclusive framework for monitoring, with all interested countries participating 
on an equal footing.

A  better  understanding  of  how  the  BEPS  recommendations  are  implemented  in 
practice  could  reduce  misunderstandings  and  disputes  between  governments.  Greater 
focus on implementation and tax administration should therefore be mutually beneficial to 
governments and business. Proposed improvements to data and analysis will help support 
ongoing evaluation of the quantitative impact of BEPS, as well as evaluating the impact of 
the countermeasures developed under the BEPS Project.
