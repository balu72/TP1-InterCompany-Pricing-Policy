ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION
AND DEVELOPMENT

The OECD is a unique forum where governments work together to address the economic, social and
environmental challenges of globalisation. The OECD is also at the forefront of efforts to understand and to

help governments respond to new developments and concerns, such as corporate governance, the

information economy and the challenges of an ageing population. The Organisation provides a setting

where governments can compare policy experiences, seek answers to common problems, identify good
practice and work to co-ordinate domestic and international policies.

The OECD member countries are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, the Czech Republic,

Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea,

Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, the Slovak Republic,

Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States. The European

Union takes part in the work of the OECD.

OECD Publishing disseminates widely the results of the Organisation’s statistics gathering and

research on economic, social and environmental issues, as well as the conventions, guidelines and

standards agreed by its members.

ACTiOn 13: 2015 Final Report

OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project
Transfer Pricing Documentation  
and Country-by-Country Reporting

Addressing base erosion and profit shifting is a key priority of governments around the globe. In 2013, OECD  
and G20 countries, working together on an equal footing, adopted a 15-point Action Plan to address BEPS.  
This report is an output of Action 13.

Beyond securing revenues by realigning taxation with economic activities and value creation, the OECD/G20 
BEPS Project aims to create a single set of consensus-based international tax rules to address BEPS, and 
hence to protect tax bases while offering increased certainty and predictability to taxpayers. A key focus of this 
work is to eliminate double non-taxation. However in doing so, new rules should not result in double taxation, 
unwarranted compliance burdens or restrictions to legitimate cross-border activity.
