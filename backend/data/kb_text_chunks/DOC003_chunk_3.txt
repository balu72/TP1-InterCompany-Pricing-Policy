Executive summary

This  report  contains  revised  standards  for  transfer  pricing  documentation  and  a 
template for Country-by-Country Reporting of income, taxes paid and certain measures of 
economic activity.

Action 13 of the Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS Action Plan, 
OECD, 2013) requires the development of “rules regarding transfer pricing documentation 
to enhance transparency for tax administration, taking into consideration the compliance 
costs for business. The rules to be developed will include a requirement that MNEs provide 
all relevant governments with needed information on their global allocation of the income, 
economic activity and taxes paid among countries according to a common template”.

In response to this requirement, a three-tiered standardised approach to transfer pricing 

documentation has been developed.

First, the guidance on transfer pricing documentation requires multinational enterprises 
(MNEs) to provide tax administrations with high-level information regarding their global 
business operations and transfer pricing policies in a “master file” that is to be available to 
all relevant tax administrations.

Second,  it  requires  that  detailed  transactional  transfer  pricing  documentation  be 
provided  in  a  “local  file”  specific  to  each  country,  identifying  material  related  party 
transactions, the amounts involved in those transactions, and the company’s analysis of the 
transfer pricing determinations they have made with regard to those transactions.

Third, large MNEs are required to file a Country-by-Country Report that will provide 
annually and for each tax jurisdiction in which they do business the amount of revenue, 
profit  before  income  tax  and  income  tax  paid  and  accrued.  It  also  requires  MNEs  to 
report their number of employees, stated capital, retained earnings and tangible assets in 
each tax jurisdiction. Finally, it requires MNEs to identify each entity within the group 
doing business in a particular tax jurisdiction and to provide an indication of the business 
activities each entity engages in.

Taken together, these three documents (master file, local file and Country-by-Country 
Report) will require taxpayers to articulate consistent transfer pricing positions and will 
provide tax administrations with useful information to assess transfer pricing risks, make 
determinations about where audit resources can most effectively be deployed, and, in the 
event audits are called for, provide information to commence and target audit enquiries. 
This  information  should  make  it  easier  for  tax  administrations  to  identify  whether 
companies  have  engaged  in  transfer  pricing  and  other  practices  that  have  the  effect  of 
artificially shifting substantial amounts of income into tax-advantaged environments. The 
countries participating in the BEPS project agree that these new reporting provisions, and 
the transparency they will encourage, will contribute to the objective of understanding, 
controlling, and tackling BEPS behaviours.
