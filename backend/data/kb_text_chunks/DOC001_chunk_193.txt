5, should not be interpreted to mean that that 
activity generates high returns. The activity could still add low value, and the 
determination of the arm’s length charge for such activity, if any, should be 
determined according to the guidance set out in paragraphs 7.1 to 7.42.

7.49.  The  following  bullet  points  provide  examples  of  services  that 
would  likely  meet  the  definition  of  low  value-adding  services  provided  in 
paragraph 7.45:

• 

• 

accounting and auditing, for example gathering and reviewing information 
for  use  in  financial  statements,  maintenance  of  accounting  records, 
preparation  of  financial  statements,  preparation  or  assistance  in 
operational and financial audits, verifying authenticity and reliability of 
accounting records, and assistance in the preparation of budgets through 
compilation of data and information gathering;

processing  and  management  of  accounts  receivable  and  accounts 
payable,  for  example  compilation  of  customer  or  client  billing 
information, and credit control checking and processing;

• 

human resources activities, such as:

- 

- 

- 

staffing and recruitment, for example hiring procedures, assistance 
in  evaluation  of  applicants  and  selection  and  appointment  of 
personnel, on-boarding new employees, performance evaluation and 
assistance in defining careers, assistance in procedures to dismiss 
personnel, assistance in programmes for redundant personnel;

training  and  employee  development,  for  example  evaluation  of 
training  needs,  creation  of  internal  training  and  development 
programmes, creation of management skills and career development 
programmes;

remuneration  services,  for  example,  providing  advice  and 
determining  policies  for  employee  compensation  and  benefits 
such  as  healthcare  and  life  insurance,  stock  option  plans,  and

pension  schemes;  verification  of  attendance  and  timekeeping, 
payroll services including processing and tax compliance;

- 

developing and monitoring of staff health procedures, safety and 
environmental standards relating to employment matters;

•  monitoring  and  compilation  of  data  relating  to  health,  safety, 

environmental and other standards regulating the business;

• 

• 

• 

• 

information  technology  services  where  they  are  not  part  of  the 
principal activity of the group, for example installing, maintaining and 
updating IT systems used in the business; information system support 
(which  may  include  the  information  system  used  in  connection 
with  accounting,  production,  client  relations,  human  resources  and 
payroll,  and  email  systems);  training  on  the  use  or  application  of 
information systems as well as on the associated equipment employed 
to collect, process and present information; developing IT guidelines, 
providing  telecommunications  services,  organising  an  IT  helpdesk, 
implementing  and  maintaining  of  IT  security  systems;  supporting, 
maintaining and supervising of IT networks (local area network, wide 
area network, internet);

internal  and  external  communications  and  public  relations  support 
(but excluding specific advertising or marketing activities as well as 
development of underlying strategies);

legal  services,  for  example  general  legal  services  performed  by 
in-house  legal  counsel  such  as  drafting  and  reviewing  contracts, 
agreements  and  other  legal  documents,  legal  consultation  and 
opinions, representation of the company (judicial litigation, arbitration 
panels, administrative procedures), legal research and legal as well as 
administrative work for the registration and protection of intangible 
property;

activities  with  regard  to  tax  obligations,  for  example  information 
gathering and preparation of tax returns (income tax, sales tax, VAT, 
property tax, customs and excise), making tax payments, responding 
to tax administrations’ audits, and giving advice on tax matters;

• 

general services of an administrative or clerical nature.

7.50.  The  following  examples  illustrate  an  important  element  of  the 
definition of low value-adding intra-group services, namely, that they should 
not  include  services  which  are  part  of  the  MNE’s  core  business.  Services 
that  may  seem  superficially  similar  in  nature  (in  the  example,  credit  risk 
analysis) may or may not be low value-adding intra-group services depending 
on the specific context and circumstances. The examples also illustrate the 
point that services may not qualify as low value-adding intra-group services

valuable intangibles.
