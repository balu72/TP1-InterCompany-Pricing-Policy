i.e.  Company  B  would  have  been  required  to  make  a  500  (instead  of  750) 
balancing payment to A.

7. 
In the absence of the CCA, Company A would purchase 10 units of 
Service 2 for the arm’s length price of 1 050 and Company B would purchase 
15 units of Service 1 for the arm’s length price of 1 800. The net result would 
be a payment of 750 from Company B to Company A. As can be shown from 
the  above,  this  arm’s  length  result  is  only  achieved  in  respect  of  the  CCA 
when contributions are measured at value.

Example 1A

The facts are the same as Example 1. In accordance with the guidance 
8. 
in  paragraph  8.27,  an  alternative  way  to  achieve  the  identical  result  under 
Example 1 is through the use of a two-step process as set out below.

9. 
Step  1  (contributions  measured  at  cost):  Company  A  should  bear 
50%  of  the  total  cost  of  5  000,  or  2  500.  The  cost  of  Company  A’s  in-kind 
contribution is 3 000. Company B should bear 50% of the total cost, or 2 500. 
The cost of Company B’s in-kind contribution is 2 000. Company B should thus 
make an additional payment to Company A of 500. This reflects a balancing 
payment associated with current contributions.

10. 
Step 2 (accounting for additional contributions of value to the CCA): 
Company A produces 20 of value above costs per unit. Company B produces 
5 of value above costs per unit. Company A consumes 10 units of Service 2 
(50 of value over cost), and Company B consumes 15 units of Service 1 (300 
of  value  over  cost).  Accordingly,  Company  A  should  be  compensated  250 
for the additional 250 of value that it contributes to the CCA. This reflects a 
balancing payment associated with pre-existing contributions.

The two-step method provides for a sharing of costs plus a separate 
11. 
and additional payment to the participant that makes an additional contribution 
of value to the arrangement. In general, the additional contribution of value 
might reflect pre-existing contributions, such as intangibles owned by one of 
the participants, that are relevant to the purpose of the CCA. Thus, the two-
step method might be most usefully applied to development CCAs.

Example 2

12. 
The facts are the same as Example 1, except that the per-unit value of 
Service 1 is 103 (that is, both Service 1 and Service 2 are low-value services). 
Assume, therefore, that the calculation of the costs and value of the services is 
as follows:

Cost to Company A of providing services (30 units × 100 per unit)

3 000

(60% of total costs)

Cost to Company B of providing services (20 units × 100 per unit)

2 000

(40% of total costs

Total cost to group

5 000

Value of contribution made by Company A (30 units × 103 per unit)

3 090

Value of contribution made by Company B (20 units × 105 per unit)

2 100

Total value of contributions made under the CCA

5 190

(59.5% of total 
contributions)

(40.5% of total 
contributions)

648 – ANNEX TO CHAPTER VIII: EXAMPLES ON COST CONTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS

Company A and Company B each consume 15 units of Service 1 and 10 units of Service 2:

Benefit to Company A:

Service 1: 15 units × 103 per unit

Service 2: 10 units × 105 per unit

Total

Benefit to Company B

Service 1: 15 units × 103 per unit

Service 2: 10 units × 105 per unit

Total

1 545

1 050

2 595

(50% of total value of 5 190)

1 545

1 050

2 595

(50% of total value of 5 190)

13. 
Under  the  CCA,  the  value  of  Company  A  and  Company  B’s 
contributions should each correspond to their respective proportionate shares of 
expected benefits, i.e. 50%. Since the total value of contributions under the CCA 
is 5 190, this means each party must contribute 2 595. The value of Company A’s 
in-kind contribution is 3 090. The value of Company B’s in-kind contribution 
is  2  100.  Accordingly,  Company  B  should  make  a  balancing  payment  to 
Company A of 495. This has the effect of “topping up” Company B’s contribution 
to 2 595; and offsets Company A’s contribution to the same amount.
14. 
In  this  example,  since  all  contributions  to  the  CCA  are  low-value 
services,  for  practical  reasons,  contributions  may  be  valued  at  cost  since 
this will achieve results which are broadly consistent with the arm’s length 
principle.  Under  this  practical  approach,  the  cost  of  Company  A’s  in-kind 
contribution  is  3  000;  the  cost  of  Company  B’s  in-kind  contribution  is 
2 000; and each participant should bear the costs associated with 50% of the 
total cost of contributions (2 500). Accordingly, Company B should make a 
balancing payment to Company A of 500.

Example 3

The facts are the same as Example 1, except that the per-unit value of 
15. 
Service 2 is 120 (that is, both Service 1 and Service 2 are equally valuable, 
and
