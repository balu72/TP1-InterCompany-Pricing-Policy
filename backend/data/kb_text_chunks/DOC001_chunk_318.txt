nistrative  Assistance  in  Tax  Matters  or  the 
Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters as amended 
by the Protocol (the “Convention”) or have signed or expressed their intention 
to sign the Convention and acknowledge that the Convention must be in force 
and in effect in relation to them before the automatic exchange of country-by-
country (CbC) reports takes place;

Whereas, a country that has signed or expressed its intention to sign the 
Convention will only become a Jurisdiction as defined in Section 1 of this 
Agreement once it has become a Party to the Convention;

Whereas, the jurisdictions desire to increase international tax transparency 
and improve access of their respective tax authorities to information regarding 
the global allocation of the income, the taxes paid, and certain indicators of the 
location of economic activity among tax jurisdictions in which Multinational 
Enterprise (MNE) Groups operate through the automatic exchange of annual 
CbC  Reports,  with  a  view  to  assessing  high-level  transfer  pricing  risks  and 
other base erosion and profit shifting related risks, as well as for economic and 
statistical analysis, where appropriate;

Whereas, the laws of the respective Jurisdictions require or are expected 
to  require  the  Reporting  Entity  of  an  MNE  Group  to  annually  file  a  CbC 
Report;

Whereas, the CbC Report is intended to be part of a three-tiered structure, 
along  with  a  global  master  file  and  a  local  file,  which  together  represent  a 
standardised approach to transfer pricing documentation which will provide 
tax  administrations  with  relevant  and  reliable  information  to  perform  an 
efficient and robust transfer pricing risk assessment analysis;

Whereas,  Chapter  III  of  the  Convention  authorises  the  exchange  of 
information for tax purposes, including the exchange of information on an 
automatic basis, and allows the competent authorities of the Jurisdictions to 
agree on the scope and modalities of such automatic exchanges;

570 – ANNEX IV TO CHAPTER V: COUNTRy-By-COUNTRy REPORTING IMPLEMENTATION PACKAGE

Whereas, Article 6 of the Convention provides that two or more Parties 
can  mutually  agree  to  exchange  information  automatically,  albeit  that  the 
actual  exchange  of  the  information  will  take  place  on  a  bilateral  basis 
between the Competent Authorities;

Whereas, the Jurisdictions will have, or are expected to have, in place 
by  the  time  the  first  exchange  of  CbC  Reports  takes  place,  (i)  appropriate 
safeguards to ensure that the information received pursuant to this Agreement 
remains  confidential  and  is  used  for  the  purposes  of  assessing  high-level 
transfer  pricing  risks  and  other  base  erosion  and  profit  shifting  related 
risks, as well as for economic and statistical analysis, where appropriate, in 
accordance with Section 5 of this Agreement, (ii) the infrastructure for an 
effective exchange relationship (including established processes for ensuring 
timely,  accurate,  and  confidential  information  exchanges,  effective  and 
reliable communications, and capabilities to promptly resolve questions and 
concerns  about  exchanges  or  requests  for  exchanges  and  to  administer  the 
provisions of Section 4 of this Agreement) and (iii) the necessary legislation 
to require Reporting Entities to file the CbC Report;

Whereas,  the  Jurisdictions  are  committed  to  discuss  with  the  aim  of 
resolving cases of undesirable economic outcomes, including for individual 
businesses, in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 24 of the Convention, 
as well as paragraph 1 of Section 6 of this Agreement;

Whereas,  mutual  agreement  procedures,  for  instance  on  the  basis  of  a 
double tax convention concluded between the jurisdictions of the Competent 
Authorities,  remain  applicable  in  cases  where  the  CbC  Report  has  been 
exchanged on the basis of this Agreement;

Whereas,  the  Competent  Authorities  of  the  jurisdictions  intend  to 
conclude this Agreement, without prejudice to national legislative procedures 
(if any), and subject to the confidentiality and other protections provided for 
in the Convention, including the provisions limiting the use of the information 
exchanged thereunder;

Now, therefore, the Competent Authorities have agreed as follows:

SECTION 1

1. 
following meanings:
