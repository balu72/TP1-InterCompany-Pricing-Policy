Competent Authority Agreement 
on the Exchange of Country-by-Country Reports 
on the basis of a Tax Information Exchange Agreement (“TIEA CAA”)

whereas, the Government of [Jurisdiction A] and the Government of [Jurisdiction B] 
intend to increase international tax transparency and improve access of their respective 
tax authorities to information regarding the global allocation of the income, the taxes paid, 
and certain indicators of the location of economic activity among tax jurisdictions in which 
Multinational Enterprise (MNE) Groups operate through the automatic exchange of annual 
CbC  Reports,  with  a  view  to  assessing  high-level  transfer  pricing  risks  and  other  base 
erosion and profit shifting related risks, as well as for economic and statistical analysis, 
where appropriate;

whereas, the laws of their respective Jurisdictions require or are expected to require 

the Reporting Entity of an MNE Group to annually file a CbC Report;

whereas, the CbC Report is intended to be part of a three-tiered structure, along with 
a global master file and a local file, which together represent a standardised approach to 
transfer pricing documentation which will provide tax administrations with relevant and 
reliable  information  to  perform  an  efficient  and  robust  transfer  pricing  risk  assessment 
analysis;

whereas,  Article  [5A]  of  the  Tax  Information  Exchange  Agreement  between 
[Jurisdiction A] and [Jurisdiction B] (the “TIEA”), authorises the exchange of information 
for  tax  purposes,  including  the  automatic  exchange  of  information,  and  allows  the 
competent authorities of [Jurisdiction A] and [Jurisdiction B] (the “Competent Authorities”) 
to agree the scope and modalities of such automatic exchanges;

whereas,  [Jurisdiction  A]  and  [Jurisdiction  B]  [have/are  expected  to  have/have, 
or  are  expected  to  have,]  in  place  by  the  time  the  first  exchange  of  CbC  Reports  takes 
place (i) appropriate safeguards to ensure that the information received pursuant to this 
Agreement  remains  confidential  and  is  used  for  the  purposes  of  assessing  high-level 
transfer pricing risks and other base erosion and profit shifting related risks, as well as 
for economic and statistical analysis, where appropriate, in accordance with Section 5 of 
this  Agreement,  (ii)  the  infrastructure  for  an  effective  exchange  relationship  (including 
established  processes  for  ensuring  timely,  accurate,  and  confidential  information 
exchanges,  effective  and  reliable  communications,  and  capabilities  to  promptly  resolve 
questions and concerns about exchanges or requests for exchanges and to administer the 
provisions  of  Section  4  of  this  Agreement)  and  (iii)  the  necessary  legislation  to  require 
Reporting MNEs to file the CbC Report;

whereas, the Competent Authorities intend to conclude this Agreement on reciprocal 
automatic  exchange  pursuant  to  the  TIEA  and  subject  to  the  confidentiality  and  other 
protections  provided  for  in  the  TIEA,  including  the  provisions  limiting  the  use  of  the 
information exchanged thereunder;
