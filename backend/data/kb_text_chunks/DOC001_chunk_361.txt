taxation  resulting  from  the 
misapplication of the international standards for transfer pricing rules leading 
to outcomes in which the allocation of profits is not aligned with the economic 
activity that produced the profits;

CONSIDERING  that  transactions  between  associated  enterprises 
may take place under conditions differing from those taking place between 
independent enterprises;

CONSIDERING that the prices of such transactions between associated 
enterprises  (usually  referred  to  as  transfer  pricing)  should,  nevertheless, 
for  tax  purposes  be  in  conformity  with  those  which  would  be  charged 
between independent enterprises (usually referred to as arm’s length pricing) 
consistent with Article 9 (paragraph 1) of the OECD Model Tax Convention 
on Income and on Capital;

CONSIDERING  that  problems  with  regard  to  transfer  pricing  in 
international transactions assume special importance in view of the substantial 
volume of such transactions;

CONSIDERING the need to achieve consistency in the approaches of 
tax administrations, on the one hand, and of associated enterprises, on the 
other hand, in the determination of the income and expenses of a company 
that  is  part  of  a  Multinational  Enterprise  Group  that  should  be  taken  into 
account within a jurisdiction.

On the proposal of the Committee on Fiscal Affairs:

I.  RECOMMENDS that Members and non-Members adhering to this 

Recommendation (hereafter the “Adherents”):

i) 

follow,  when  reviewing,  and  if  necessary,  adjusting  transfer 
pricing  between  associated  enterprises  for  the  purposes  of 
determining taxable income, the Guidelines – considering the 
whole  of  the  Guidelines  and  the  interaction  of  the  different 
chapters – for arriving at arm’s length pricing for transactions 
between associated enterprises;

APPENDIX: RECOMMENDATION OF THE COUNCIL [C(95)126/FINAL] – 655

ii)  encourage  taxpayers  to  follow  the  Guidelines;  to  that  effect 
Adherents should give the Guidelines publicity and have them 
translated, where necessary, into their national language(s);

iii)  develop further co-operation, on a bilateral or multilateral basis, 

in matters pertaining to transfer pricing.

II.  INVITES  Adherents  to  notify  the  Committee  on  Fiscal  Affairs 
of  any  modifications  to  the  text  of  any  laws  or  regulations  that 
are  relevant  to  the  determination  of  transfer  pricing  or  of  the 
introduction of new laws or regulations.

III.  INVITES Adherents and the Secretary-General to disseminate this 

Recommendation and the Guidelines.

IV.  INVITES non-Adherents to take due account of and adhere to this 

Recommendation.

V. 

INSTRUCTS the Committee on Fiscal Affairs to:

i)  pursue  its  work  on  issues  pertinent  to  transfer  pricing  and 

modify the Guidelines as necessary;

ii)  monitor  the  implementation  of  this  Recommendation,  in 
co-operation with the tax authorities of Adherents and with the 
participation of the business community and other stakeholders 
and  report  to  Council  in  light  of  this  monitoring  every  five 
years;

iii)  develop its dialogue with jurisdictions that have not adhered to 
this Recommendation with the aim of assisting them to become 
familiar  with  the  Guidelines,  and  to  adhere  to  the  present 
Recommendation.

OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines 
for Multinational Enterprises and Tax 
Administrations
In a global economy where multinational enterprises (MNEs) play a prominent role, 
governments need to ensure that the taxable profits of MNEs are not artificially shifted 
out of their jurisdiction and that the tax base reported by MNEs in their country reflects 
the economic activity undertaken therein. For taxpayers, it is essential to limit the risks 
of economic double taxation. The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines provide guidance 
on the application of the “arm’s length principle”, which is the international consensus 
on the valuation of cross‑border transactions between associated enterprises.

This January 2022 edition includes the revised guidance on the application of the transactional 
profit method and the guidance for tax administrations on the application of the approach 
to hard‑to‑value intangibles agreed in 2018, as well as the new transfer pricing guidance 
on financial transactions approved in 2020. Finally, consistency changes have been made 
to the rest of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines 
were approved by the OECD Council in their original version in 1995.
