OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project

Transfer Pricing Documentation  

and Country-by-Country Reporting

Addressing base erosion and profit shifting is a key priority of governments around the globe. In 2013, OECD  

and G20 countries, working together on an equal footing, adopted a 15-point Action Plan to address BEPS.  

This report is an output of Action 13.

Beyond securing revenues by realigning taxation with economic activities and value creation, the OECD/G20 

BEPS Project aims to create a single set of consensus-based international tax rules to address BEPS, and 

hence to protect tax bases while offering increased certainty and predictability to taxpayers. A key focus of this 

work is to eliminate double non-taxation. However in doing so, new rules should not result in double taxation, 

unwarranted compliance burdens or restrictions to legitimate cross-border activity.

Foreword

International  tax  issues  have  never  been  as  high  on  the  political  agenda  as  they  are 
today.  The  integration  of  national  economies  and  markets  has  increased  substantially  in 
recent years, putting a strain on the international tax rules, which were designed more than a 
century ago. weaknesses in the current rules create opportunities for base erosion and profit 
shifting (BEPS), requiring bold moves by policy makers to restore confidence in the system 
and ensure that profits are taxed where economic activities take place and value is created.

Following  the  release  of  the  report  Addressing  Base  Erosion  and  Profit  Shifting  in 
February  2013,  OECD  and  G20  countries  adopted  a  15-point  Action  Plan  to  address 
BEPS in September 2013. The Action Plan identified 15 actions along three key pillars: 
introducing coherence in the domestic rules that affect cross-border activities, reinforcing 
substance requirements in the existing international standards, and improving transparency 
as well as certainty.

Since  then,  all  G20  and  OECD  countries  have  worked  on  an  equal  footing  and  the 
European  Commission  also  provided  its  views  throughout  the
