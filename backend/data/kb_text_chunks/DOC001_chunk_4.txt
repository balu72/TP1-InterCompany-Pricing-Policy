PREFACE – 11

Preface

The  role  of  multinational  enterprises  (MNEs)  in  world  trade  has 
1. 
continued to increase dramatically since the adoption of these Guidelines in 
1995. This in part reflects the increased pace of integration of national economies 
and  technological  progress,  particularly  in  the  area  of  communications.  The 
growth of MNEs presents increasingly complex taxation issues for both tax 
administrations and the MNEs themselves since separate country rules for the 
taxation of MNEs cannot be viewed in isolation but must be addressed in a 
broad international context.

These  issues  arise  primarily  from  the  practical  difficulty,  for  both 
2. 
MNEs and tax administrations, of determining the income and expenses of 
a company or a permanent establishment that is part of an MNE group that 
should  be  taken  into  account  within  a  jurisdiction,  particularly  where  the 
MNE group’s operations are highly integrated.

3. 
In the case of MNEs, the need to comply with laws and administrative 
requirements  that  may  differ  from  jurisdiction  to  jurisdiction  creates 
additional problems. The differing requirements may lead to a greater burden 
on  an  MNE,  and  result  in  higher  costs  of  compliance,  than  for  a  similar 
enterprise operating solely within a single tax jurisdiction.

4. 
In  the  case  of  tax  administrations,  specific  problems  arise  at  both 
policy and practical levels. At the policy level, jurisdictions need to reconcile 
their legitimate right to tax the profits of a taxpayer based upon income and 
expenses that can reasonably be considered to arise within their territory with 
the need to avoid the taxation of the same item of income by more than one 
tax jurisdiction. Such double or multiple taxation can create an impediment 
to  cross-border  transactions  in  goods  and  services  and  the  movement  of 
capital. At a practical level, a jurisdiction’s determination of such income and 
expense allocation may be impeded by difficulties in obtaining pertinent data 
located outside its own jurisdiction.
