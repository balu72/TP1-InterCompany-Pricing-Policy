on  activities  of  Company  B 
related to the licensed intangibles.

Under these circumstances, the application of the transactional profit 
69. 
split should be based on the profits anticipated to be generated by Company B 
from  commercialising  the  products  over  an  appropriate  period  (e.g.  using 
a  discounted  cash  flow  valuation  technique  as  described  in  Chapter  VI, 
Sections D.2.6.3 and D.2.6.4 of these Guidelines).

70. 
The  relative  value  of  the  contributions  made  by  Company  A  and 
Company  B  will  be  used  to  determine  a  split  of  the  anticipated  profits  of 
Company B resulting from the combined contributions of the enterprises. The 
payment for the transaction may take a variety of forms, including a lump 
sum payment to Company A or a sales-based royalty.

Scenario 2

71. 

In this scenario the accurately delineated transaction shows that:

•  Company A and Company B agree to a split of the actual profits from 

the sale of the products by Company B

•  Company A and Company B will jointly perform the marketing and 

distribution activities related to the trademarked products, and

•  Both Company A and Company B assume risks associated with the 
success or otherwise of the marketing and commercialisation of the 
products by Company B

72. 
Under  these  circumstances,  the  transactional  profit  split  method 
applies to the actual profits achieved from the sales of the products and the 
relative value of the contributions made by Company A and Company B will 
be used to determine the split of those profits.

Example 14

Below  are  some  illustrations  of  the  effect  of  choosing  a  measure 
73. 
of  profits  to  determine  the  relevant  profits  to  be  split  when  applying  a 
transactional profit split method.

Scenario 1

74. 
Assume  A  and  B  are  two  associated  enterprises  situated  in  two 
different  tax  jurisdictions.  Both  manufacture  the  same  widgets  and  incur 
expenditure that results in the creation of a unique and valuable intangible 
which they can mutually use. For the purpose of this example, it is assumed 
that the nature of this particular unique and valuable intangible is such that 
the value of A and B’s respective unique and valuable contributions in the 
year  in  question  is  proportional  to  A  and  B’s  relative  expenditure  on  the 
intangible  in  that  year.  (It  should  be  noted  that  this  assumption  will  not 
always be true in practice.) Assume A and B exclusively sell products to third 
parties. Assume that it is determined that the most appropriate method to be 
used is a residual profit split method; that the manufacturing activities of A 
and B are less complex, non-unique transactions that should be allocated an 
initial return of 10% of the Cost of Goods Sold; and that the residual profit 
should  be  split  in  proportion  to  A’s  and  B’s  expenditure  in  relation  to  the 
unique and valuable intangible. The following figures are for illustration only.
