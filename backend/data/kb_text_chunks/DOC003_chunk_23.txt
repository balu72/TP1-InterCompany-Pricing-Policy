Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement 
on the Exchange of Country-by-Country Reports

whereas, the jurisdictions of the signatories to the Multilateral Competent Authority 
Agreement  on  the  Exchange  of  Country-by-Country  Reports  (the  “Agreement”)  are 
Parties of, or territories covered by, the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance 
in Tax Matters or the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters as 
amended by the Protocol (the “Convention”) or have signed or expressed their intention to 
sign the Convention and acknowledge that the Convention must be in force and in effect in 
relation to them before the automatic exchange of country-by-country (CbC) reports takes 
place;

whereas, a country that has signed or expressed its intention to sign the Convention 
will  only  become  a  Jurisdiction  as  defined  in  Section  1  of  this  Agreement  once  it  has 
become a Party to the Convention;

whereas,  the  jurisdictions  desire  to  increase  international  tax  transparency  and 
improve  access  of  their  respective  tax  authorities  to  information  regarding  the  global 
allocation of the income, the taxes paid, and certain indicators of the location of economic 
activity among tax jurisdictions in which Multinational Enterprise (MNE) Groups operate 
through the automatic exchange of annual CbC Reports, with a view to assessing high-level 
transfer pricing risks and other base erosion and profit shifting related risks, as well as for 
economic and statistical analysis, where appropriate;

whereas, the laws of the respective Jurisdictions require or are expected to require the 

Reporting Entity of an MNE Group to annually file a CbC Report;

whereas, the CbC Report is intended to be part of a three-tiered structure, along with 
a global master file and a local file, which together represent a standardised approach to 
transfer pricing documentation which will provide tax administrations with relevant and 
rel
