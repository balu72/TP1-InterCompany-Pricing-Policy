ment around the time of the restructuring that mean 
that  past  performance  is  not  an  indicator  of  profit  potential.  For  example, 
competing products could have the effect of eroding profitability, and new 
technology or consumer preferences could render the products less attractive. 
The consideration of these factors from perspective of the distributor can be 
illustrated with the following example.

Note: This example is for illustration only. It is not intended to say anything about 
the choice of the most appropriate transfer pricing method, about aggregation of 
transactions, or about arm’s length remuneration rates for distribution activities. 
It  is  assumed  in  this  example  that  the  change  in  the  allocation  of  risk  to  the 
distributor derives from the renegotiation of the existing distribution arrangement 
which reallocates risk between the parties. This example is intended to illustrate 
the perspective of the distributor. It does not take account of the perspective of the 
foreign  associated  enterprise  (principal),  although  both  perspectives  should  be 
taken into account in the transfer pricing analysis.

9.47. 
In scenario no. 1, the distributor is surrendering a profit potential with 
significant  uncertainties  for  a  relatively  low  but  stable  rate  of  profitability. 
Whether an independent party would be willing to do so would depend on 
its  anticipated  return  under  both  scenarios,  on  its  level  of  risk  tolerance, 
on  its  options  realistically  available  and  on  possible  compensation  for  the 
restructuring  itself.  In  case  scenario  no.  2,  it  is  unlikely  that  independent 
parties  in  the  distributor’s  situation  would  agree  to  relocate  the  risks  and 
associated  profit  potential  for  no  additional  compensation  if  they  had  the 
option  to  do  otherwise.  Scenario  no.  3  illustrates  the  fact  that  the  analysis 
should take account of the profit potential going forward and that, where there 
is a significant change in the commercial or economic environment, relying 
on historical data alone will not be sufficient.

E. Transfer of something of value (e.g. an asset or an ongoing concern)

9.48. 
Sections E.1 to E.3 below contain a discussion of some typical transfers 
that  can  arise  in  business  restructurings:  transfers  of  tangible  assets,  of 
intangibles and rights in intangibles, and of activities (ongoing concern).

E.1. Tangible assets

9.49.  Business  restructurings  can  involve  the  transfer  of  tangible  assets 
(e.g. equipment) by a restructured entity to a foreign associated enterprise. 
One common issue relates to the valuation of inventories that are transferred 
upon the conversion by a restructured manufacturer or distributor to a foreign 
associated  enterprise  (e.g.  a  principal),  where  the  latter  takes  title  to  the 
inventories as from the implementation of the new business model and supply 
chain arrangements.

Illustration

Note: The following example is solely intended to illustrate the issue of valuation 
of inventory transfers. It is not intended to undertake an analysis of the transactions 
comprising the business restructuring as accurately delineated under Section D.1 
of Chapter I, nor is it intended to suggest that a particular transfer pricing method 
is always acceptable for restructured operations.

9.50.  Assume a taxpayer, which is a member of an MNE group, used to 
operate as a “full-fledged” manufacturer and  distributor.  According to the 
pre-restructuring  business  model,  the  taxpayer  purchased  raw  materials, 
manufactured  finished  products  using  tangible  property  and  intangibles 
that  belonged  to  it  or  were  rented/licensed  to  it,  performed  marketing  and 
distribution functions and sold the finished products to third party customers. 
In doing so, the taxpayer assumed a series of risks such as inventory risks, 
bad debt risks and market risks.

9.51.  Assume  the  arrangement  is  restructured  and  the  taxpayer  now 
operates as a so-called “toll-manufactur
